# LLM Vectorizer Implementation

This repository contains implementations and experiments related to vectorization using Large Language Models (LLMs) and traditional techniques. It aims to explore and compare the performance, correctness, and efficiency of AI-assisted and manually optimized vectorization.

## Features

- **Non-vectorized vs. Vectorized Implementations**: Comparative analysis of traditional loops and optimized vectorized alternatives.
- **AI-Generated SIMD Transformations**: Investigating how AI can assist in generating SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) transformations.
- **AVX Optimizations for Matrix Multiplication**: Utilizing Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) to improve performance.
- **Verification of Vectorized Code**: Addressing correctness challenges in vectorized implementations.
